            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE Subject of this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> being a <hi>Divine</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe upon the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Heavens at that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of Time wherein a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon was born, may peradventure be leſs acceptable unto thee, (the Art of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> whereupon this depends) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo generally exploded by the ſtricteſt Profeſſors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="tcp:36617:3"/>of what kind ſoever) than if <hi>Divinity</hi> had been treated of after ſome other manner. Yet, in regard <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf in the dayes of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy eſteemed of as is <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> in theſe dayes, and that by Zealous <hi>Profeſſors</hi> too, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees:</hi> I hope it may in ſome meaſure appear unto thee, that all things are not to be totally rejected which are lightly eſteemed of, nor to be neglected, which are evilly ſpoken of, ſince the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord may reveal ſomething beneficial to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb facs="tcp:36617:3"/>out of ſuch things as are aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I hope thy <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi> will prevent a raſhneſs in thy <hi>Judgment,</hi> as touching the Subject-matter of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> more eſpecially if thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt it not; ſince it is an Act of Imprudence for any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to condemn ſuch things as he doth not underſtand.</p>
                  <p>That the Stars were ſet for <hi>Signs</hi> before the Fall of man, when all things were in a ſtate of <hi>Purity,</hi> the Holy Scriptures imply, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. And if ſo, then they muſt neceſſarily ſignifie
<pb facs="tcp:36617:4"/>holy things; and, as they are for <hi>Signs</hi> in theſe dayes, what are they more likely to ſignifie than the Appearance of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in Spirit to his people? which is a matter of no leſs Concern than man's everlaſting Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I have little more to annex, onely I think it requiſite to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> That in regard the word <hi>[Native]</hi> is frequently made Uſe of in the Second part of this <hi>Book,</hi> the <hi>outward Perſon</hi> of the Party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is not alwayes meant thereby, but for the moſt part, and in a more eſpecial manner,

                        <hi>Evangelium Sydereum,</hi> THE FIRST PART, BEING A Philoſophical Diſcourſe leading to the Second.</head>
                     <p>GOD who is pure, in order to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his promiſe made of old to the Sons of Men, hath vouchſafed, of his infinite love, to become the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Teacher of all thoſe who are willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his Divine Doctrine; yea, his Love is ſuch, and ſo immenſe, that he hath ſowed the ſeed of Eternal Life in every mans boſome, but (the more is the pity) it lies oppreſſed under the Tares of Iniquity; for moſt men do diſregard it, and choak it with the burthen of Sin and Tranſgreſſion: This is the love of God unto ungrateful men, <hi>viz.</hi> he who is Light, and in whom is no Darkneſs at all; he, I ſay, who is the King of kings, and Lord of Lords, hath vouchſafed to come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to teach the Sons of men, or rather to teach
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36617:14"/>them in the place of his abode, which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he being Light, as aforeſaid, hath put his Law into mens Hearts, and his Spirit into their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, by yielding obedience unto which, he becomes their God and they his People: This is he who gives his good Spirit to the Rebellious, yea, to all men in general, for he is no Reſpecter of Perſons: The Spirit of God, which is Light, is put into the Inward parts; hence it appears, that there is a holy light within man; the Law of the Spirit of Life is Light, and is put into the Heart; and ſince the Heart is within man, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity follow, that the Light of Life is ſeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man: This is that Light within, which unfolds all Myſteries both Natural and Divine, unto which I recommend all thoſe that are willing to become the Sons of Wiſdom, as to an holy and immediate Inſtructor in all things whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Theſis.</label> The Stars, as Coagents with God their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, converſe with, and have their Influences and Effects upon the Soul of man, and that in order to its Salvation; they give Divine Viſions and Revelations.</p>
                     <p>For the proof of this Poſition, I ſhall elect two or three portions of Sacred Scripture, making them <hi>Baſes</hi> whereupon to raiſe my Arguments:</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Baſis.</label> The Inviſible things of God from the Creation of the World are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36617:14"/>the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead; ſo that men are left without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, <hi>Rom. 1.20.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Argument.</label> The viſible Heavens are a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of the Creation, and Synonoma's to the Inviſible, which are the Throne of God, whereas he calls the Earth his Foot-ſtool; moreover, the Heavens had their Priority in the Order of the Creation, for we read, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth;</hi> obſerve the Order, <hi>viz.</hi> He firſt created the Heaven, and then the Earth, as a Dependent upon the Heaven, to the end it might ſubſiſt: but <hi>the Earth was without Form, and void, Gen.</hi> 1.2. We do not read that the Heaven was ſo. Hence it appears, that the Heavens are a more worthy part of the Creation, and ſuch a part hath God made choice of, whereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his holy Wonders, and to explain the Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of his Kingdom; the Heavens are a principal part of that Book by which we read their Omnipotent Creator; Now the inviſible things of God (who is a Spirit and Immortal) cannot be ſeen but by the Spiritual, Immortal, and Inviſible part of man, which is the Soul; for his Earthly part, which is his Body, cannot ſtand before the Rayes of ſuch reſplendent Glory.</p>
                     <p>If the Heavens never have an Effect upon the Soul, by giving a Sight or Viſion of the Eternal Power and Godhead, then I affirm, that they give it to no purpoſe; which to conclude were Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36617:15"/>but they have an Effect by giving a <hi>Viſion</hi> of Gods Glory, for his Eternal Power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is clearly ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle; which ſeeing is a Viſion; Now to ſay that Viſions of God are given to no purpoſe, is blaſphemous. If the Inviſible and Eternal Power and Godhead are ſeen by the means aforeſaid, then the Everlaſting Father and the Son Chriſt Jeſus are ſeen, to ſee whom is Life Eternal; here is a fight of the Worlds Saviour, given by that part of the viſible Creation, which was appointed to declare his Glory, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heavens; and the ſight of this Saviour hath an Effect upon the Soul, for it gives Life Everlaſting by working its Converſion.</p>
                     <p>If Jeſus, the Power of God be ſeen, and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the viſible Heavens, then they preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for the Revelation of Jeſus is the Preaching of the Goſpel, or glad tidings of Salvation unto the Sons and Daughters of men.</p>
                     <p>Now if this Doctrine of the Heavens never have an Effect, then is it vain; which to affirm were blaſphemous; from thence would ariſe this abſurd Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Heavens, as part of the Creation, were ordained to ſhew forth the Inviſible things of God, and that in order to mans Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by declaring Jeſus the Eternal Power of the Father; but this Ordinance is void, having no Effect, for 'tis evident, that whatſoever is without Effect, is void: Therefore, ſince it is abſurd and blaſphemous to make the aforeſaid Concluſion, it will on the contrary be regular and pious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36617:15"/>that the Heavens have an Effect upon the Soul, by declaring and giving a clear Sight or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Inviſible things of God, and of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is intended for mans Salvation. Hence it appears, that the Stars of Heaven converſe with, and have Effects upon the Soul of man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intent of the fore-going <hi>Theſis,</hi> which was to be proved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Baſis 2.</label> The Heavens declare the Glory of God, <hi>&amp;c. Pſalm 19.1.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Argument.</label> If the Heavens declare the Glory of God, (which Glory is Spiritual and Inviſible) then they muſt of neceſſity declare it to the Soul of man, which is alſo Spiritual and Inviſible, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely fit receptacle in man of that Glory; for the Body, which is mortal, cannot make its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before ſo Divine a Principle, and retain its Being, neither is there any Unity or Commerce betwixt Carnal and Spiritual things.</p>
                     <p>If the Heavens declare the Glory of God, then they declare Jeſus the Eternal Son of God; for the Son is the Glory of the Father, and the Son and Father are united.</p>
                     <p>If they declare Jeſus, then they preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; for the Declaration of Jeſus is the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>If the Heavens declare the Glory of God (which is Spiritual,) then they give Viſions of that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but the Heavens declare the Glory of God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36617:16"/>(which is Spiritual,) <hi>ergo</hi> they give Viſions of that Glory; for a Declaration in this caſe, is a making manifeſt, clear, and apparent to the eye of the Soul; Now the Spiritual Glory, or glorious Spirit of God, being thus made manifeſt, is a Sight or Viſion of God, and of his Glory.</p>
                     <p>If the Heavens declare the Glory of God, then they make manifeſt the Glory of God, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation is a Viſion; but the Heavens declare the Glory of God, <hi>ergo,</hi> they make manifeſt the Glory of God, which Manifeſtation is a Viſion. Hence it appears, that the Heavens being created by God to declare his Glory, they, by that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, have an Effect upon the Soul, in giving Viſions of his Glory: and ſince a Viſion of God is a Revelation of Jeſus, 'tis evident alſo, that the Heavens do Evangelize, or Preach the Goſpel, and that univerſally; for, <hi>there is no Speech nor Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage where the voice of the Stars is not heard; their line is gone out through all the Earth, and their words to the end of the World:</hi> Pſalm 19. verſ. 3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince the Heavens ſo largely extend their Virtue towards mankind, and that in order to its Salvation, it is evident, that the <hi>Blacks</hi> of <hi>Africk</hi> have not ſuch cauſe to curſe their Stars, as ſome have ſaid, but rather to bleſs them.</p>
                     <p>Alſo, ſince it is made apparent, that the Heavens give Viſions of Gods Glory, it is not improperly by me affirmed in ſome part of this Treatiſe, that the Poſitions, Dignities, Aſpects, and Tranſits of the Planets, in the Radical and Revolutional Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36617:16"/>gave Divine Viſions and Revelations.</p>
                     <p>A Viſion of God is a ſymptome of his Love, therefore when a Viſion is given, the fervour of holy Love is alſo given. Hence appears the truth of the following Paraphraſe, as it is in ſome part of this Book, <hi>viz. Sol</hi> directed to the Body of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Lady of the Ninth, <hi>gave the reſplendent fervour of holy Love,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now, if the Celeſtial Inhabitants, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant Stars, adminiſter ſuch gifts unto the Soul, much more might they give or effect the death of the Natives Mother, by removing her Soul from its earthly Tabernacle, into a ſtate of everlaſting Bliſs and Glory; and this according to the Power, Order, and Divine appointment of their mighty Creatour.</p>
                     <p>I believe few will deny, that the Heavens, as <hi>Mediums,</hi> produce upon, and in the Earth, the growth of Vegetables and Minerals; Now, if ſome veneniferous Vegetable or Mineral being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Body of man, hath power to deſtroy Life, by ſeparating the Soul from the Body, or ſome other, endued with a Cordial property, hath power to reſtore decayed Nature by the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life; much more then may the Influence of the Stars, which gave ſuch Vegetables or Minerals their Nature and Being, effect the Death, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Life of Mankind; for <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Scripture it ſelf doth evidently manifeſt, that the Stars have power to cut off mans Life:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36617:17"/>and (to ſhew that they have eminent Power given them, the Scripture frequently calls them the Hoſt of Heaven) the ending of Life after which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, is alſo accompliſhed to Gods Honour and Glory, and that in the deſtruction of his Enemies; for we read, <hi>Judges</hi> 5.20. that the Stars in their courſes fought againſt <hi>Siſera;</hi> thus ſung <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> who had delivered <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Siſera:</hi> Now, ſince the Stars fought againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> 'tis evident that they ſlew him in the Conflict by <hi>Jael,</hi> an Inſtrument in Gods hand, who drove a nail through his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p>Now the precedent Paragraph ſeems to give way to this Objection, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> The Stars, by their Effects, are the Cauſes of evil Deſtiny to mortal men, and bring them to untimely ends.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Circumſtances of the death of <hi>Siſera,</hi> before hinted at, if read at large, as they preſent themſelves in the holy Scripture, <hi>Judges</hi> the fourth chapter; and ſeriouſly conſidered, will ſufficiently anſwer this Objection; for <hi>Siſera</hi> the Captain of <hi>Jabin</hi> King of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who had oppreſſed the Iſrael of God twenty years, went againſt <hi>Barak</hi> the friend of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> with intention to ſubdue him, that ſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might ſtill remain under the ſame Oppreſſion; but God being his Averſary, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Divine Juſtice upon him, and that by the Stars of Heaven, which fought againſt him, and got the Victory; thus was Iſrael miraculouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36617:17"/>out of the hands of its Oppreſſors. Hence it appears, that the Stars are as Inſtruments in Gods hand, whereby to inflict Judgments upon the wicked, and to execute Juſtice upon his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; they alſo ſhew forth the wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances which he can accompliſh by their means: Hereby it is alſo evident, that they are no more concerned in the evil Deſtiny of Perſons, than the Law is, which brings Malefactors to the place of Execution for evil doing: but the no leſs merciful than juſt God, many times takes pity upon ſuch Offenders, by giving them Repentance, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the evil Accidents which attend thoſe that offend him, all which is done in love towards them; ſo that coming to a ſhameful end, as before men, yet their condeſcending Lord doth compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately receive them, not deſpiſing them in that reproachful ſtate of Death, though men may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, but receiving them into the Arms of everlaſting Glory.</p>
                     <p>Other Malefactors being alſo ſummon'd by the Heavens to the place of Execution, (for I averr that theſe things have been found true by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and been truly predicted from the Poſition of Heaven at the Birth, as alſo the time prenoted by directions) may have ſinned out their day, and ſo given up by God (being forſaken of him) to a ſtate of everlaſting miſery: I ſay, that the time of the violent Death of Malefactors hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted by the <hi>Art of Directions,</hi> and that from the Birth; as alſo the violent Death of others (and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36617:18"/>the time thereof) who never were executed as Delinquents, or breakers of any Law, either Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or Civil, but have received their Death by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; yea, the time of the Natural Death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hath been predicted from the Birth by Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tranſits in the Nativity, and may again be predicted without impeachment of Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or a detraction from his Mercy; for his Wonders in Heaven are thus declared, and he acts many times in ſuch ſort as that Humane Reaſon cannot dive into the Myſtery of ſuch Wonders, yea, ſome of his Wonders in Nature we cannot give reaſons for, though found true by Experience; therefore Experiences are not to be rejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unbelieving Opponents cannot be convinced of them, for want of Rational Arguments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vindicate them; neither doth it always ſeem good unto God, to ſhew unto <hi>his righteous People</hi> the myſtery of his Proceedings, whether in things Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or Divine.</p>
                     <p>It is a hard matter to ſhew a reaſon why the Glo-worm ſhines by night, or why the Magnetick Needle reſpects the Arctick Pole; as alſo, why the little <hi>Remora</hi> ſtops a ſhip upon full ſail, by hanging upon the Keel; yet the two firſt of theſe have been obvious to the eyes of moſt men, and the laſt ſometimes experienced by Navigators, to their great admiration.</p>
                     <p>I my ſelf do affirm, (and that in the preſence of Almighty God, who knows the ſecret thoughts and intents of my heart, and before whoſe All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36617:18"/>eye every thing lies open and bare) that I have witneſſed the truth of the Rules of Aſtrology, and of the meaſure of Time by Directions in the Heavens, and this in reference both to things Spiritual and Temporal: as to things Spiritual, ſurely no one will deny, that the courſe of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous mans Life is ſteered by a <hi>Direction</hi> from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for the juſt mans path cannot be walked in without <hi>heavenly Inſtitutions or Directions.</hi>

                     <p>Anſw. Yet it follows not, but that <hi>at the coming of the Kingdom we may obſerve wonderful things,</hi> and that in the viſible Heavens too, yea, and according to the time ſuiting with the <hi>Arch of Direction:</hi> this I am a living witneſs of, and dare do no leſs than affirm the truth of my own experience. And as to what I have written in this Book, the Contents thereof are Coeleſtial Demonſtrations of my Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Experiences, at the Coming of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unto me, for I can teſtifie, that at the glorious appearance of the holy Dove, the Heavens were moved, and ſhewed the time unto my Soul. Now,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36617:19"/>that there ſhall be wonderful things ſeen in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, may be made apparent from ſeveral portions of Scripture, whereof I ſhall onely give in one for inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There ſhall be Signs in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars,</hi> Luke 21.25. and theſe are the Signs of the Times which the Hypocrites heart could not diſcern, yet the Signs themſelves ſhew their Times.</p>
                     <p>But, having made this ample Digreſſion, 'tis now time to return to my former purpoſe, which was, to prove, that the Stars have Effects upon the Soul of man, and that from the ſecond Baſis afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, <hi>viz.</hi> Baſis 2. <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God,</hi> Pſalm. 19.1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argument.</hi> If the Heavens declare the Glory of God, then that Declaration muſt have Effect; for otherwiſe it is vain, and to no purpoſe: Now to ſay that God created the Heavens to declare his Glory in vain, is the production of an Abſurdity, to avoid which, we muſt of neceſſity acknowledge that their Declaration hath an Effect, and ſuch a one as <hi>David</hi> himſelf experienced; for he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by excited to glorifie God, in ſaying, <hi>The Heaveas declare the Glory of God.</hi> Hence it is apparent, that by the Heavens their Declaration of the Glory of God, the laſt mentioned Scripture was given forth; and the Heavens declaring the Glory of God, thereby declare Jeſus the Son of God, for the Son is the Glory of the Father, as is aforeſaid, and in declaring Jeſus, they declare that holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36617:19"/>by which the other Scriptures were given forth.</p>
                     <p>If the Stars have no Effect, then were they crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vain; but ſince they were ſet for Signs, they have Effect, for they work an effect upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, in ſhewing what they ſignifie.</p>
                     <p>If the Stars operate upon the Soul and Spirit, and not upon the Body, or upon the Body, and not upon the Soul and Spirit, then the Harmony in mans Creation is deſtroyed, and the Sympathy betwixt the Soul and Body in this Life annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but that there is this Sympathy is evident to all men, for when the Soul is ſeparated from the Body, then the Body dyes: Now to abandon theſe Enormities, it will be prudence to conclude, that the Stars do effectually operate both upon the Soul and Body.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> The Rules of Aſtrology, and names of the Signs made Uſe of in this Treatiſe, are falſe, and were invented by the Heathens, therefore no truth can ariſe from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> Having before lately proved how the Scriptures were given forth by God in the Heavens, I ſhall introduce my Anſwer to this Objection with theſe following Syllogiſms, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Syl.</hi> 1. If the Rules of Aſtrology, and names of the Signs be lively demonſtrations, or apparent and intelligible manifeſtations of the Words and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Holy Scriptures, (whoſe Pillar and Foundation is Truth it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the Creator of all things) then the ſaid Rules and Names are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36617:20"/>true; But the Rules of Aſtrology and Names of the Signs are lively Demonſtrations, <hi>&amp;c. ergo,</hi> the ſaid Rules and Names are true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Syl.</hi> 2. If the Rules of Aſtrology, and Names of the Signs do accurately ſhew forth the Words and Circumſtances of the Sacred Scriptures, which had their original from the Creatour of all things, then they ſhew forth ſuch things as are of greater Antiquity than the Heathen or their Fictions; But the Rules of Aſtrology and Names of the Signs, do accurately ſhew forth the Words and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c. ergo,</hi> they ſhew forth ſuch things as are of greater Antiquity than the Heathen, or their Fictions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Syl.</hi> 3. If the Rules of Aſtrology, and Names of the Signs ſhew forth ſuch things as are of greater Antiquity than the Heathen or their Fictions, then the Heathen never invented them; but the Rules of Aſtrology and Names of the Signs ſhew forth, as aforeſaid, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Heathen never invented them.</p>
                     <p>It is very improbable that the Heathen ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Rules and Names to ſhew forth things which they either never knew, or never believed, <hi>viz.</hi> the truth of the Holy Scriptures, which were given forth by that Spirit of Life which is more ancient than themſelves.</p>
                     <p>But admit the Heathen did give them forth, ſince they manifeſt the Truths aforeſaid, it muſt needs be confeſſed, that God revealed them unto them, thereby to declare his Omnipotency, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36617:20"/>therefore not to be rejected: If ſo (which is not impoſſible) what cauſe have the Sons of men to praiſe his holy name, who by ſuch improbable means can declare his Wonders unto them?</p>
                     <p>The Book it ſelf ſufficiently proves the verity of the fore-going Syllogiſms, to the peruſal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I ſhall refer the Aſtrologer, as my moſt compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge in this caſe; yet I ſhall here give in an inſtance or two out of the Book, whereby to prove the Verity of the foreſaid Rules and Names, which Inſtances the Aſtrologer may compare (becauſe exempted therefrom) with the Figure of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix inſerted hereafter, at the beginning of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part.</p>

                        <p>Now let the Impartial Artiſt judge, whether or no there be a wonderful Harmony betwixt the Rules followed in the fore-going Inſtances, and the quoted Scriptures, he cannot but acknowledge that there is ſuch an Harmony or Conſent betwixt them, as may ſufficiently evince, that the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit gave forth the Rules, which gave forth the Scriptures; and likewiſe proves, that <hi>Saturn</hi> is Lord of the Sign <hi>Aquarius, Sol</hi> of <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Gemini,</hi> which are the Rules, the truth whereof was to be proved.</p>

                        <p>Hence I hope the Aſtrologer cannot but confeſs on my behalf, and in the defence of the former Syllogiſms, that the aforeſaid Rules, and Names of the Signs, are Demonſtrations and manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sacred matter contained in the Scriptures, which were given forth by the Spirit of God, who is of greater Antiquity than either the Heathen, or their fictitious Inventions, But in my opinion it ſeems contrary to the Law of Humane Reaſon, yea, of common Senſe it ſelf, that the wicked Heathen (for I ſuppoſe my Opponent means the worſt ſort of them) ſhould be conceived by any man to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36617:22"/>the Inventors of ſuch Rules and Names of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, as demonſtrate the Prophecies of the Servants of God, ſo as they are recommended to us in Holy Writ; more eſpecially conſidering that the Scriptures of Truth are as a ſealed Book unto them.</p>

                        <p>Theſe Names coming into their hands (perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture when the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was ranſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who undoubtedly was acquainted with the Divine, no leſs than the Natural Myſteries of the Creation) they might ſo far be given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as to know that the ſaid Names were enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſome Divine property or ſignification of Future things, whereupon they endeavoured, by a ſtrict obſervation of ſuch Contingencies as fell out amongſt them, as alſo of ſuch Accidents, which by any means they might come to be informed of, to make theſe Names preſignificant of the ſaid Contingencies: As for inſtance, the Heathen ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the name of the Sign <hi>Leo,</hi> they ſtill expected to have the reſult of the prophetical ſignification of that name accompliſhed amongſt them, or at leaſt-wiſe to hear of its accompliſhment elſewhere; whereupon, in proceſs of time, obſerving ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant man (as for inſtance, <hi>Hercules</hi>) to ſlay a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36617:22"/>Lyon in the Wood <hi>Nemaea,</hi> as they ſay: Hence they judged, that the myſterious meaning of that Name was then fulfilled, and that (as peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they would pretend) by their fore-knowledge, then led on with vain-glory, they would needs have the Actors which were concern'd in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of this Prophecy (<hi>viz. Hercules,</hi> and his ſlain <hi>Nemaean</hi> Lyon) to be ſtellified in Heaven, as Monuments (not indeed of the truth of their Prophecy, as they would have it, but) of their erroneous Idolatry; thus was the Name of the Sign <hi>Leo</hi> by the Heathen miſapplied, and <hi>Hercules</hi> by them fictitiouſly ſtellified; but the Spirit of God hath unfolded the true meaning of this Name unto me, intimating that it ſhews forth the <hi>Lyon of the Tribe of</hi> Judah <hi>in Heaven,</hi> who is from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting, though <hi>Hercules</hi> and the <hi>Nemaean Lyon</hi> (if any ſuch Creatures there were, for if not, 'twas onely a Fiction) be vaniſhed for evermore.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> The Rules of Aſtrology uſed in this Tract, are falſe, which is apparent from the manifold Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Aſtrologers in their Predictions, by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Rules.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reply.</hi> This Objection is weak, and not ſuitable in this place, for though I follow the ſame Rules, yet I uſe them not to the ſame intent and purpoſe, they predict ſuch things only as may probably fall out according to the courſe of Nature, which are temporal, I uſe them in the demonſtration of things ſpiritual; ſo that how far Demonſtration and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36617:23"/>do differ, as alſo how far things Temporal and Viſible do differ from things Spiritual and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſo far is this Objection impertinent to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but admit the Rules were falſe, in predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things temporal, yet it doth not therefore follow, that they are unfit to demonſtrate things Spiritual; for the ſame Rules may ſerve truly for one intent and purpoſe which may not ſerve for another. Yet this I affirm, that the Rules may be true for the Aſtrologers intent in predicting out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Contingencies, notwithſtanding his Errours, which ought rather to be imputed to his miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Rules (wherein is couched a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery) than to any falſhood in them; <hi>Ars enim ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra eſt, ſed pauei Artifices reperiuntur.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> If the Rules of Aſtrology be lively Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the Holy Scripture, then they are a Cauſe of them; for a Demonſtration in a Syllogiſm is of the higheſt nature, and is a Cauſe of the thing demonſtrated; therefore, if the Rules be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a Cauſe of the Scriptures, the Syllogiſms will not hold truly Logical.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> If my Antagoniſt carp at the word <hi>[live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly]</hi> this I muſt tell him, that ſince he is a Scholar, and, I believe, a Rhetorician, ſurely he cannot but know, that words are not always taken in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe, and the word <hi>[lively]</hi> (if Logick do not altogether exclude Rhetorick) may be taken for <hi>[intelligible]</hi> per <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and ſo Demonſtration for Repreſentation (or ſuch like) by the ſame Trope: but that I may not ſeek thus to evade him,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36617:23"/>I ſhall endeavour to prove the Validity of my Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſms, though the words thereof be taken in the ſtricteſt ſenſe that may be, and that in ſuch manner and form as Aſtronomy (being the ſubject of this Treatiſe) will admit of.</p>
                        <p>A Demonſtration in Aſtronomy is that which repreſents to the view of the Eye, or rather of the Intellect, the ſeveral varieties of the Coeleſtial mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that by right and circular Lines protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in plano,</hi> or by circular Lines only circumſcribed on a Globe. Now I queſtion not but that Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers may have the privilege of arguing ſyllogiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally as well as men of other Functions in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in order to vindicate the truths of their Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and may likewiſe uſe the word <hi>[Demonſtration]</hi> in a Syllogiſm, according to the ſenſe above deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, without making any breach upon the Rules of Logick; if ſo, my Argument is firm and Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſtill, ſince I pretend to no other than an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical Demonſtration of Divine Revelation, and that from the Poſition of the Heavens at the preciſe time of Birth, which Poſition was found by Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation Trigonometrical, or a mutual proportion of Sinical, Tangent, and Secant Lines amongſt one another, and from the <hi>Theſis</hi> of Heaven thus found, as upon a <hi>Ba ſis,</hi> the Judgment (preſenting it ſelf in this Book) was raiſed. Hence it appears, that my Opponent fell ſhort in not diſtinguiſhing upon the word <hi>[Demonſtration]</hi> ſince it is apparent that a Delmonſtration is not alwayes a Cauſe (as he would have it) of the thing demonſtrated, but the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36617:24"/>thing demonſtrated ſometimes a cauſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; for 'tis evident, that the Motions of the Heavens may be ſhewn forth by Lines, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, yet it were abſurd to conclude that lineal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to be the cauſe of thoſe Motions, but rather thoſe Motions the Original of that Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration: Hence alſo it appears, that the Heavens may demonſtrate the Circumſtances and Words of the Holy Scriptures, without being a Cauſe of them: Yet I doubt not but that I could (if I thought it expedient ſo to do) prove in ſome meaſure, that the Rules of Aſtrology, conſidered in their moſt ſublime Senſe, are a cauſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; yea, and that ſuch proof is poſſible, the Judicious Reader may caſily diſcern by my fore-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments; but I ſhall refrain therefrom, leſt I ſhould give offence to many honeſt minded Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p>Now, leſt ſome ſhould ſuppoſe that I judge the whole courſe of man' Life to have an abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Poſition of the Heavens at Birth, in ſuch ſort as to make the Stars guilty of their Evil Inclinations, and ſo conſequently of their Sins, which frequently bring them to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely End, I think it requiſite to diſcourſe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon that Subject, although I have in part done it before; and firſt I ſhall lay down this Poſition in order thereunto, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Poſitio. <hi>The Righteous and Penitent man ſuffers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently under God's Judgments, and under all manner of ſuch inevitable Tribulations and Exerciſes both External
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36617:24"/>and Internal, as God in his Juſtice ſhall ſee good, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon him for the tryal of his Faith; but on the contrary, the impenitent Sinner rejects the Mercies of God, frequently tendred unto him, neither ſubmits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to bear patiently the aforeſaid Exerciſes, that ſo thereby his Soul may be purified; I ſay, he rejects them, until ſuch time as the day of his Viſitation be over.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God the Creator of all things, by the Poſition of the Heavens at Birth, ſhews the good and evil Inclinations which Mankind ſhall be prone or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto; as alſo all good and evil Accidents like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to befall him during the whole term of Life, the truth whereof I my ſelf have experienced, and do ſtill daily experience, to my great admiration and aſtoniſhment; and though I could give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for theſe things, yet I dare not but confeſs to the certainty of them; yet this I know (which may ſtand for ſome reaſon, though dangerous to be too deeply div'd into) that there hath been, is, and will be a ſecret hand of Divine Providence in all mens tranſactions under the Sun, of what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether good or evil, and that in order to the preſervation of his Saints in Glory.</p>
                        <p>The Judgments of the Lord are the Diſcovery of Wickedneſs in its moſt horrid appearance, and the Lord by the Heavens is willing to diſcover unto every man the manner how the ſpiritual Enemy of his Soul will make intruſions upon him, in order that he may patiently bear them, waiting for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from his Maker, who is only able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36617:25"/>him out of the thraldom brought upon him by the Prince of the power of the Air, working in the hearts of the children of diſobedience, as they are in the Fall. So that though this Enemy of Mankind may, by the Almighty's permiſſion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inflict grievances upon the Righteous (ſuch as are prenoted by the Heavens at Birth) for the exerciſe of their Faith and Patience; yet, as their Eye is unto God, they ſhall ſee ſuch Evils work for their everlaſting welfare, the Eye of Heaven ſweetly reflecting the Rayes of Love upon them, when the Sentence ſhall be pronounced, <hi>viz. Theſe are they which have come through great tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having waſhed their robes white in the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> Revel. 7.14. Then ſhall the viſible Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens give in their teſtimony, thereby to juſtifie their Patience, in ſuch Exerciſes; But, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Wicked ones are either voluntarily act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the power of the Enemy, and with a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſure through his Wiles, betrayed into everlaſting perdition, being ſwallowed up into the Abyſs of Darkneſs, becauſe they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the Sacred Light, in mercy beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; or otherwiſe have through cowardiſe fallen under the temptation of the Enemy, and fled from Judgment, wilfully oppoſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of the Holy One, not ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the yoke of Patience, but have continued in Rebellion ſo long, as that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Spirit of Jeſus hath departed from them, who ſaith, that his <hi>Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with man,</hi> Gen. 6.3. And if the Heavens fill the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36617:25"/>Ungodly with outward Bleſſings at any time, (for we read, that <hi>the wicked ſometimes flouriſh as a green Bay-tree</hi>) the ſame Heavens and thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ſhall teſtifie againſt their Unrighteouſneſs to their greater condemnation, but when the Stars ſeem to frown upon the Righteous, by bringing Croſſes and Adverſity upon them, 'tis onely for the tryal of their Patience: Now the Righteous themſelves have ſometimes been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up into the hands of wicked men, to ſuffer as Malefactors, a (ſeemingly Ignominious, though) really Honourable Death, by Martyrdome; the time of whoſe Death (yet I will not ſay the Cauſe) may poſſibly be predicted from their Birth, by the <hi>Theſis</hi> of the Heavens thereupon, and the <hi>Art of Directions;</hi> Neither ſhall I affirm, that the Cauſe of a Wicked mans Violent Death may be predicted; yet, that there is a poſſibility of predicting the Time of both their Deaths, whether Natural or Violent, as alſo of all other remarkable Tranſactions, during the term of Life, I do abſolutely affirm, and that by the Art of Aſtrology too; but they that are endued with the Spirit of God can beſt perform theſe Predictions by the aforeſaid Science; for the Judgment of all others is too much obſcured with Darkneſs, neither are the Secrets of the Almighty truly revealed to any other Perſons but ſuch as fear him.</p>
                        <p>They that ſhall ſcruple at the Truth of theſe things (which I believe ſome may do, and thoſe truly honeſt and righteous Perſons too) might, I am aſſured, receive ample ſatisfaction, would they but truſt the time of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36617:26"/>their Geneſis or Nativity into ſome honeſt Perſon's hand, who hath skill in the Aſtral Language; for they ſhould not only have recounted to them the time of their firſt Appearance, but alſo the time when all other Accidents, yet to come, ſhall unveil themſelves before them; and all theſe things may be diſcovered, according to the order of Time wherein they will happen; when they have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced theſe things, they can do no leſs than glorifie God for revealing his Wonders ſo mighty in Heaven.</p>
                        <p>The Scriptures themſelves teſtifie, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are ordained by God, to inflict his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the ſinful, but to diſpenſe his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies amongſt the Righteous; for, ſaith he, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Wicked, <hi>Thy Heaven that is over thy head ſhall be Braſs, and the Earth that is under thee ſhall be Iron,</hi> Deut. 28.23. But, on the contrary, promiſes the Righteous, <hi>that he will hear the Heavens, and the Heavens ſhall hear the Earth, and the Earth ſhall hear the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl, and that the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oyl ſhall hear them,</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea 2. verſ. 21, 22. Theſe Scriptures I have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed to be fulfilled in a Spiritual ſenſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can ſet my Seal to the truth of them; for, ſince I became obedient unto God, I have felt the Divine Influences of the viſible Heavens ſweetly ſhed abroad within my Soul, (and that according to the Order of their Motions) giving pleaſant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and moſt fragrant odours; yea, the whole Creation hath been preſented before the Eyes of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36617:26"/>my Soul, moſt concinnate, beautiful, and glorious, whereas, whilſt I rebelled againſt my Creator, (merciful in Love and Condeſcenſion) my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was to me as Braſs, and my Earth as Iron: for the Virtue operating is altered by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Wiſdom, according to the nature of the Subject receiving; The Sun makes the Clay hard, but the Wax ſoft, by the ſame fervour of his Rayes: The Heavens ſterilize the Land of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but make the Land of the Righteous fertil, as is before proved: Yet any Poſition of the Heavens whatever, retains its glorious Excellency; ſince they never ſwerv'd from that Divine Order, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by the immediate Command of God) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were firſt created.</p>

                        <p>Now the Eclipſes here objected againſt, were effected by Mutual Tranſits of the <hi>Luminaries</hi> over the Bodies of one another in the <hi>Radix,</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal Luminary having at that time either little Latitude, or none at all: and if what appertains to true Religion, or Spiritual Matter be Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, then, ſince <hi>Luna</hi> in the Celebration of theſe Eclipſes is Lady of the Ninth Houſe in the <hi>Radix, Caput Draconis</hi> being therein, and <hi>Luna</hi> in the Third, applying to the Conjunction of <hi>Venus,</hi> it is evident they were Supernatural; and, as they were Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo were they the more ſignificant of Spiritual and Inviſible things; the manner how they are demonſtrated to be Supernatural, may be ſeen in the ſecond Part.</p>
                        <p>But, to return to mean Capacities, I ſhall here inſert what hath been proved by Experience, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Power of <hi>Tranſits.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It hath been frequently obſerved, that when the <hi>Moon</hi> hath tranſited, or paſſed over the place where the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> was in the Scheme, or Poſition of Heaven, ſet for the time wherein a Perſon firſt fell
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36617:35"/>ſick of a burning Fever, which time is called the <hi>Decumbiture;</hi> I ſay, it hath been obſerved, that at the time when this Tranſit was made, <hi>the ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath been violently afflicted, the Diſeaſe being more intenſe;</hi> yea, although the real Body of <hi>Mars</hi> hath been <hi>alibi</hi> in the Heavens, then the <hi>Moon</hi> then was, peradventure, many Signs diſtant, and out of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with her, yet hath <hi>the burning Heat been ſtrangely augmented:</hi> and if <hi>Mars</hi> at the <hi>Decumbiture</hi> was Lord of the Houſe of Death, (no benevolent Rayes of good Planets intervening to cut off the <hi>Tranſit</hi>'s malignant Influence) <hi>then hath the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent yielded up his Spirit into the hands of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I my ſelf, by ſuch like Obſervations as aforeſaid, have predicted the Death of a ſick Perſon (a Week before-hand) to an hour, and of ſuch a Perſon as I never had any thing to do withal by way of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Adminiſtration. Theſe words I am conſtrain'd to annex, leſt ſome envious Perſon ſhould dare to ſay, that I might adminiſter Poyſon to the aforeſaid Party, near the time foretold, thereby to verifie my Prediction.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon of the ſaid Effects of <hi>Luna's</hi> Tranſits over <hi>Mars</hi> his Body, is, becauſe the Seal and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his virtue is left there where he was at the Ingreſs of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>On the contrary, <hi>Luna</hi> tranſiting the Body of <hi>Venus,</hi> being Governeſs of good Houſes, and free from Affliction, the Diſeaſe at that time hath been more remiſs, and the Patient's Body cooled, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36617:36"/>that without the adminiſtration of refrigerant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
                        <p>From the fore-going Circumſtances it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the <hi>Eclipſes</hi> by <hi>Tranſit</hi> treated of in the ſecond Part of this Book, are not Imaginary but Real, and really Effectual as well as Artificial; and ſince the <hi>Moon</hi> is Lady of the Houſe of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Radix,</hi> they are alſo Effectual, as to matter of Divine ſignification.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> Aſtrologers themſelves will account this Book but a whimſey, and therefore its publication can be of little benefit to them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is one of my <hi>Opponent</hi>'s Arguments, whereby he would have diſſwaded me from expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Treatiſe to publick view; but ſurely had he conſidered, that the Truth of God it ſelf, and his holy Worſhip, is accounted whimſical, by the prophane Perſons of this our Age, he would have ſought to convince me by more ſolid Reaſon. What is more ſcoffed, flouted, derided, and jeered at, than true Religion it ſelf? yet the Truth is not therefore to be evilly thought of by any one, or leſs eſteemed of by thoſe who have experienced the goodneſs of it, by receiving it in the love thereof; neither is the preaching and publication thereof to be neglected. And if the experienced Truths of Aſtrology be accounted whimſical by Aſtrologers themſelves (though grounded upon the Principles of their own Art) or by any other Perſons, I ſhall not therefore in the leaſt decline from affirming the truth of ſuch Experiences, nor from the publication
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36617:36"/>of them; more eſpecially conſidering, that there lyes upon my Spirit no reſtraint from God, as to the contrary; but that the benefit of Aſtrologers is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thereby, it being a ſalutation of Love and Mercy unto their Souls, granted me (upon my earneſt Supplication unto God) to deliver forth unto them, whereby they may be ſatisfied that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation is not ceaſed, here being a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the ſame, according to the Precepts of their own Science, and thoſe without the leaſt alteration.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things will ſtand in Authority over the hireling Prieſts of our time, who poſſeſs the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a belief, that God reveals not himſelf in theſe dayes, as he hath done in former Ages.</p>
                        <p>As to the Vindication of this <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> if objected againſt by Aſtrologers, becauſe founded upon a particular Geniture, being the time when the <hi>Native</hi> was a new-born Babe, I recommend to their ſerious Conſideration theſe following Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>viz. Out of the mouthes of Babes and Sucklings haſt thou perfected praiſe,</hi> Matth. 21, 16.—<hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 11, 25. Theſe portions of Scripture being ſeriouſly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (more eſpecially after the peruſal of the ſecond Part of this Book) may come to work an Effect upon ſuch an Objector, both of great Wonder and Satisfaction.</p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:36617:37"/>
                        <p> But if any Aſtrologer ſhall reflect upon ſo general a Judgment, extending it ſelf to the Eſtates of of others, from a particular Geniture and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie him of the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof, not onely by Artificial Reaſons, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Principles of his own Science, but alſo by Scriptural.</p>
                        <p>The experienced Verity of Directions, few Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers (I ſuppoſe) will deny.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Courſe of a Righteous man's Life is ſteered by a</hi> Direction <hi>from Heaven:</hi> But to proceed.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall firſt begin with Reaſons from Scripture, by repeating again one of the former quotations, as it is in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 8.2. <hi>viz. Out of the mouthes of Babes and Sucklings haſt thou ordained Strength,</hi> ſaith the holy Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who was guided by the Spirit of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> If from the mouthes of Babes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Strength be ordained, for whom is it ordained, but unto others? As if the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>Thou, O Lord, wilt adminiſter ſtrength unto others out of the mouthes of Sucklings,</hi> &amp;c. From a due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what is afore ſaid, I may hope that <hi>this ſmall Treatiſe</hi> will tend to the Benefit of <hi>Aſtrologers;</hi> and when I ſpeak of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> or <hi>Wicked</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, by inferring a ſignification of good or evil unto them, from ſuch Poſitions, Aſpects, &amp;c. as preſent themſelves to view in the particular Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; in ſo doing I may thus vindicate my ſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> There is an Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, amongſt thoſe that are born of God, and they have power given them to diſcern the ſtate of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36617:37"/>the Enemies of the Great <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Moreover, the Lord is not tyed unto mens wayes and manners, or obliged to ſatisifie their corrupt humours, he will chuſe what Poſition of Heaven pleaſes him to ſhew forth <hi>generals</hi> and <hi>particulars</hi> too, for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are his, and who can reſtrain him? But that Noble Creature Man hath all Myſteries <hi>in himſelf;</hi> he hath the Spirit of the Divine Being, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds all Myſteries <hi>in his Soul:</hi> God can ſhew forth the <hi>general</hi> ſtate of Kingdoms to a <hi>particular</hi> man by Divine Inſpiration, and from his particular <hi>Radix</hi> at Birth, he can chuſe what Poſition of the Heavens he pleaſes to glorifie himſelf withal, either in a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> way.</p>
                        <p>Now to come to <hi>Aſtrological</hi> Reaſons whereby to prove, that a <hi>General Judgment</hi> may be given from a <hi>particular Geniture,</hi> and from the preſignified Effects of a <hi>particular</hi> Direction.</p>
                        <p>Let us ſuppoſe from the <hi>Nativity of a King,</hi> that upon ſome <hi>Coeleſtial Direction</hi> he is likely to become the Vanquiſher of his Enemies, this Direction doth not onely manifeſt its Power in reſpect of the King, as a <hi>Conquerour,</hi> but alſo in reſpect of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of his Enemies, as being <hi>conquered.</hi> Here it is apparent, that a general Judgment relating to the ſtate of the King's Enemies (which poſſibly may conſiſt of ſeveral Nations) is deduced from a <hi>Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Direction</hi> in the <hi>particular Geneſis</hi> of the King: Or let it be ſuppoſed, that upon a <hi>Direction</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, his Subjects ſhall be loving and loyal unto him, this <hi>Direction</hi> doth not onely diſplay its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36617:38"/>in reſpect of the King, as being a <hi>Governour</hi> but alſo of his Subjects <hi>Qualifications</hi> and <hi>ſuitable Demeanour,</hi> in ſhewing forth their Loyalty unto him. The like may be judged from the <hi>Geneſis</hi> of a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Perſon, as concerning his Servants, their Love and Fidelity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence, I hope, it is made apparent enough, and that from the <hi>Aſtral Science</hi> it ſelf, that a <hi>general Judgment</hi> may be given as touching the Affairs of others, from a <hi>particular</hi> Nativity.</p>
                        <p>Yet I ſhall make it undeniably manifeſt, (by producing the Seal of the Great King of Heaven to warrant my Aſſertion) that the Judgment in this Book given, is of general Concern to <hi>the Nation of England, &amp;c.</hi> this ſhall be done near the beginning of the third Part, where I have placed the Scheme of <hi>Sol's</hi> Ingreſs into <hi>Aries</hi> for the year 1677, to be compared with the Radical Figure at Birth, that ſo the wonderful Unity of thoſe two <hi>Coeleſtial Themes</hi> may be obſerved; which time of the Ingreſs is intercepted betwixt the two extreme Limits of that year, wherein the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi> to <hi>Luna's</hi> Body (ſhe being Lady of the Houſe of Religion) did begin to operate, whoſe Effects are the Subject-matter of this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe;</hi> for the ſaid <hi>Direction</hi> began to manifeſt its effectual Splendour (in ſummoning the Native to appear at the Court of Heaven) about the 30th of the 5th Month call'd <hi>July,</hi> in the year 1676, as may appear by the Calculation; and the Figure of <hi>Sol's Ingreſs</hi> harmonizing, is that of the year 1677,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36617:38"/>as aforeſaid, which is ſeven Months and ſomewhat more diſtant from the time wherein the ſaid <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the <hi>Luminaries</hi> began to iſſue forth its <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Operation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> My <hi>Opponent</hi> takes an occaſion againſt me, as being guilty of Contradiction, becauſe he finds the Planet <hi>Saturn</hi> in one part of this Treatiſe term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Significator</hi> in Religion; in another part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>the Enemy of Mankind;</hi> and therefore Queries how theſe things will be reconciled?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> This <hi>Objection</hi> is weak and frivolous, as will appear, if the ſecond <hi>Inſtance</hi> before-going, uſed to prove the Verity of Aſtrological Rules, be but well obſerved; for in that <hi>Inſtance,</hi> although <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> as he is Lord of the 4th, ſignifying <hi>the Grave,</hi> or <hi>mortality</hi> of Man, is the Enemy of Mankind; yet in reſpect of his Situation in the Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> being the place of his Fall, and of his Poſition in the 6th, a Cadent Houſe, where he is Retrograde; I ſay, in this reſpect, he is a good <hi>Significator</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> foraſmuch as he portends <hi>the Grave to be fallen by the Lamb,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15.55.</p>
                        <p>So from the firſt <hi>Inſtance, Mercury,</hi> though Lord of Death, is a good <hi>Significator</hi> in Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by his <hi>immerſion in the Solar Rayes</hi> (<hi>Sol</hi> being Lord of the <hi>Medium Coeli</hi>) he ſhews <hi>Death to be ſwallowed up in Victory,</hi> Iſaiah 25.8.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Reaſons (I preſume) do apparently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the fore-going Objection, and bring the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>ſeeming</hi> Differences to a <hi>perfect</hi> Reconciliation, as was required.</p>

                  <p>God being a Pure and Holy Spirit, and the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ordained for his Service, according to his Divine Appointment and Wiſdom; it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity follow, that the things created do in their Places, according to their Specifick Properties recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, ſerve him as he is, <hi>viz.</hi> a Spirit.

<pb facs="tcp:36617:45"/>of his Heavenly Spirit in the Inward Parts, and of the fulfilling of the Law in their hearts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gracious extent of the new Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> chap. 31. 33, 34, verſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. I ſay, to ſuch as are of an humble and contrite Spirit, and tremble at his Word (which is nigh in the heart, and in the mouth, and is God) he reveales his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, enlightening their Apprehenſion after an aſtoniſhing manner, in the more occult Myſteries of the Creation, ſtill opening the <hi>Treaſures of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> after a more plentiful manner continually, and diſcovering Sacred things, beyond the power of Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, ſo that the Tongue is ſilenc'd; yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Conception, the Senſes being overcome, and the Soul delightfully raviſhed with the ſweetneſs of their Contemplation: the love of the holy and gracious Lord God (which is Love indeed) powerfully ſubduing them by its gentle, delicate, and tender dealings with them, accoſting them mildly, and with his comfortable Embraces wonderfully refreſhing them. He draweth them with his <hi>fragrant Odours,</hi> and over-ſhadows them with the wings of his <hi>pleaſures,</hi> and his Fruit is <hi>ſweet</hi> to their Taſte. He doth even more than ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them, giving them cauſe to praiſe him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth ſo plentifully ſhower down his ſweet, intellectual, and inviſible Bleſſings upon them; and then for thoſe Praiſes (he being the Subject of their Praiſe, yea even the Praiſe it ſelf) he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their cups to overflow with his undeclarable Love more than before; ſo that they are conſtrain'd to

For the more they praiſe him, the more abundant cauſe to praiſe him is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them; there being a mutual provocation in Love betwixt their Praiſes and his Glory, ſo that zealous for one another, they are even more than United by theſe inviſible and moſt ſweet Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals.

                     <p>The Meaſure of Time, according to this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, is the allowance of a day for a year; for as all the Points of the Ecliptick paſs through the 12 <hi>Manſions</hi> in the ſpace of 24 hours, or a Natural Day, ſo the Sun makes his Circuit through all the ſaid Points of the Ecliptick in a year; which is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Proof in Art, that a day muſt ſtand for a year.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, This Meaſure of Time is countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſeveral paſſages of Holy Scripture, where we may read, that a Day is the meaſure of Time for a Year, as to the accompliſhment of <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, with other circumſtances of Sacred Writ which are here omitted; Now, ſince a Day for a Year is the meaſure of Time allowed for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of Divine Prophecies, why not the ſame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Time for the accompliſhment of Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Myſteries, or ſuch myſterious Tranſactions as are made by the Stars in Heaven; more eſpecially conſidering, that the moſt Divine and Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the Mover of the Heavens, adminiſtring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them their powerful Influences? Now, ſince the Heavens never ſwerv'd from the Command of their Maker, (whoſe Works are all Divine) they being <hi>Synonoma's</hi> to the inviſible Throne of his Glory,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36617:51"/>whereon he ſwayes the Scepter of his Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, muſt of neceſſity be privileged above any other part of the Creation (man excepted) to ſpeak forth Sacred and Myſterious Predictions; for, <hi>the Heavens declare the Glory of God,</hi> from whoſe Spirit the <hi>effluvia</hi> of all Divine prenarrations are exhaled. But to proceed.</p>
                     <p>The Moon paſſing through all the Signs of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> in a Month, and theſe Signs paſſing through the twelve Houſes in a Natural Day, are a rational ground in Art, that a Day ſhall ſtand for a Month as well as for a Year, in this way of <hi>Direction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here 'tis evident, that this meaſure of time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the two great Luminaries of Heaven, to whoſe reſplendent Influences it ſeems rational to judge, (if their radiant Luſtre may teſtifie for them) that the Influences of the other Planets and fixed Stars are ſubordinate.</p>
                     <p>In commending this, I do not go about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode <hi>Argol</hi>'s way, far be it from me, ſince I have found much Verity therein, but ſhall rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there is truth to be found out by both theſe wayes.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall here give a brief <hi>Specimen</hi> of the Directions operating (according to Doctor <hi>Salmon</hi>'s new way) the one and thirtieth year of the Native's Age current, as followeth; being found out by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection onely, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <p>Now, for ſome Reaſons not long ſince rehearſed, the <hi>Luminaries</hi> were totally <hi>eclipſed,</hi> as well at, as after the Birth, as to the <hi>Native;</hi> for if we have the like conſideration to <hi>Sol</hi>'s tranſiting the places of <hi>Luna's Nodes</hi> in the <hi>Radix,</hi> both as to <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> as we have already had of his <hi>Tranſits, oppoſite</hi> and <hi>conjunct,</hi> over her Nodes in the world, we may diſcern that the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> were eclipſed in the <hi>Radix,</hi> or at Birth, after the ſame manner as they were in the World, <hi>viz. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</hi>

                        <p>Conſider that both the <hi>Luminarie's Eclipſes</hi> in the <hi>Radix</hi> happen in the ſelf-ſame particle of the Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptick, <hi>viz.</hi> in 10 deg. 39 min. of the fixed and true Sign <hi>Aquarius,</hi> as alſo in the ſame preciſe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> in the World; ſo that they are totally eclipſed upon the Bodies of one another, and ſo conſequently <hi>Luna</hi> is totally eclipſed at the <hi>Change,</hi> which is alwayes, according to Nature, at the <hi>Full:</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Sol</hi> totally eclipſed at the <hi>Full Moon,</hi> which is alwayes, according to Nature, celebrated at the <hi>Change:</hi> Theſe intimate that <hi>the Moon is confounded, and the Sun aſhamed,</hi> ſhewing himſelf to be aſhamed, by his total Eclipſes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of one hiding his face for ſhame, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 24.23.</p>
                        <p>It is obſervable, that <hi>Sol</hi> touches the <hi>Ecliptick Line</hi> thrice, and the ſame Point thereof twice, and all this in a little ſpace of time, for he firſt tranſits the place of <hi>Cauda</hi> in the world, (where <hi>Luna</hi> met with it before ſhe came to its place in the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> which is before demonſtrated) and afterwards paſſes over its place in the <hi>Radix,</hi> at which time

                           <hi>Cauda</hi> being Retrograde, tranſlates his Tincture back again to its place in the World, which is equivalent to his touching the ſame point of the Ecliptick <hi>twice,</hi> by means of his twofold Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aforeſaid to <hi>Cauda</hi> in a ſtate of <hi>Retrogradation</hi> at Birth, for <hi>Cauda</hi> never ſwerves from the <hi>Ecliptick Line.</hi> Theſe intimate, that the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> Line ſeems to be <hi>dilated,</hi> as alſo, that the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtaggers in his Courſe, which is a <hi>ſhame</hi> unto him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 24.23. By imputing the ſame ſtate to <hi>Luna,</hi> (yet with conſideration of her ſmall Latitude at Birth) in her application to her South <hi>Node,</hi> which hath even now been imputed to <hi>Sol,</hi> it may appear that ſhe is <hi>confounded;</hi> the reaſon whereof is, becauſe <hi>Sol</hi> Lord of the <hi>Medium Coeli</hi> in the <hi>Radix,</hi> as a <hi>Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator,</hi> is aſpected of all the Planets, and <hi>directed</hi> to her Body, ſhe being Lady of the Ninth Houſe, and poſited in the Third, which is the Sixth from the Tenth, applying to the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Venus, &amp;c.</hi> which intimates, <hi>that the Lord of Hoſts reigns in Mount Sion,</hi> (<hi>Sol</hi> paſſing into <hi>Capricorn,</hi> a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Sign) <hi>and in Jeruſalem, and before his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents gloriouſly, whereat the Moon is confounded and the Sun aſhamed,</hi> as was before demonſtrated.

                        <p>Now obſerve, that the <hi>Moons Nodes</hi> by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of their <hi>Retrograde</hi> Motion before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, will each of them appear to be two-fold, which in the myſtery of their Names are called <hi>Capita &amp; Caudae Draconis,</hi> repreſenting the Terrours and Judgments of the Almighty.

                        <p>But to return to former proceedings.</p>
                        <p>The Planet <hi>Sol</hi> in his <hi>Tranſits</hi> having met with, and paſſed over that reproach-giving <hi>Node Cauda</hi> in the World, is immediately beſieged betwixt <hi>Cauda</hi> in the World, and <hi>Cauda</hi> in the <hi>Radix,</hi> the Center of his Body being intercepted betwixt them, <hi>whereat he is aſhamed,</hi> plainly manifeſting his <hi>ſhame</hi> by his total Eclipſes, not knowing how to ſteer his Courſe according to his uſual Cuſtom, ſo as that his <hi>ſhame</hi> may be avoided; this conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it further appears, <hi>that the Sun is aſhamed, Iſa.</hi> 24.23.</p>

                        <p>Now, I ſay, by conſidering all theſe aforeſaid Teſtimonies, (which are a concatenation of Proofs) it is evident, that the Moon is confounded, and the Sun aſhamed, becauſe of the Lord of Hoſts reigning in Mount <hi>Sion</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and before his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, gloriouſly, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 24.23.

                        <p>There is a myſtery in the number <hi>Three,</hi> it being a number of Perfection, and the fulfilling or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing

                        </p>
                        <p>There is a <hi>threefold</hi> total Eclipſe of the two <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries</hi> (by reaſon of their aforeſaid Motions) upon the Bodies of one another, in <hi>Aquarius,</hi> a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and durable <hi>Sign;</hi> the firſt of them on <hi>Cauda</hi>'s place in the World, the next on <hi>Cauda</hi>'s place in the <hi>Radix,</hi> both theſe being accompliſhed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Motion, the laſt on <hi>Cauda</hi>'s place in the World, by <hi>Retrograde tranſlation;</hi> for the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the twice totally eclipſed <hi>Luminaries</hi> aforeſaid, is forcibly tranſlated back by <hi>Cauda</hi>'s being <hi>Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade</hi> in the <hi>Radix,</hi> to the place of their aforeſaid total Eclipſes, on its place in the World; ſo that this third and laſt Eclipſe being tinged with the virtue of the ſecond, and now falling upon the firſt. makes a <hi>three-fold</hi> total Eclipſe of the <hi>Lights,</hi> near the ſame moment of Time, and near the ſame place of the Ecliptick, to the eye of the inviſible world.
